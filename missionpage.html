<p> Our main goal with this app is to discourage the insecurities associated with being unhappy with one&#39;s body shape, weight, height, etc. Both young girls and young women feel as if they have to fit into the mold that society places upon them to look a certain way in order to be considered pretty and successful. However this is not the case. When girls are insecure about what they wear it&#39;s mostly because they feel unhappy about how they look. This decreases self esteem and confidence and can lead to other life-endangering problems such as depression, anorexia, and bulimia. Everyone should accept and love themselves no matter how they look. Styling themselves according to these different factors can make all the difference as there is a perfect style for everyone no matter how they look. With this app, the user will be able to get customized recommendations to hopefully make them feel better in their own skin and give them the confidence boost that they need.
